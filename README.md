## Synopsis

This is a module to test the cron scheduler in Magento 2 based on the most basic skeleton module for Magento 2.

## Motivation

There are some cron issues that are hard to reproduct, so I made this to help reproduct the issue and test a workaround.

## Technical feature

This component helps demonstrates issues with cron.  I'll add more details here later.

## Installation

This module is intended to be installed using composer.  After including this component and enabling it, you can verify it is installed by going the backend at:

STORES -> Configuration -> ADVANCED/Advanced ->  Disable Modules Output

Once there check that the module name shows up in the list to confirm that it was installed correctly.

## Tests

I may add some automated later, but I'm not sure if they will work in the normal Magento 2 testing framework.
